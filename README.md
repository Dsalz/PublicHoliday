# PublicHoliday

- Just something i thought of during a particularly long day at work

- It's a site that counts down to the nearest holiday

- I see it as a kind of morale booster when the trenches are running low that there's a holiday around the corner

- Can be viewed here [http://dsalz.github.io/PublicHoliday].
